                    <p><strong>Thermoelectric effect</strong> The phenomenon of producing electricity by keeping the
                        junction of
                        thermocouple at different temperature is called thermoelectric effect. Thus produced current is
                        called
                        thermoelectric current and the emf is called thermoelectric emf. The thermo emf depends upon the
                        nature of
                        material forming the thermocouple and difference in temperature between the junction.</p>

                    <p><strong>Thermo-couple:</strong> A pair of dissimilar metal forming a couple in order to produce
                        electricity is
                        called thermocouple.</p>

                    <p><strong>Thermoelectric series</strong>: An arrangement of metal forming a thermocouple in order
                        to produce
                        thermoelectricity is called thermoelectric series. The thermoelectric series is given below</p>

                    <p><strong>Sb, Fe, Zn, Ag, Pb, Cu, Pt, Co, Bi </strong></p>

                    <p>From thermoelectric series we can say that greater the length between the metal selected from
                        thermoelectric
                        series more will be the emf produced and vice versa. Also the direction of current is from
                        earlier metal to
                        later one in thermoelectric series through cold junction.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Seebeck effect:</strong></p>

                    <p>The phenomenon of producing thermoelectric current by keeping the junction of thermocouple at
                        different
                        temperature is called seebeck effect. It is also known as thermoelectric effect</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Variation of thermo-emf with the temperature of junction of thermocouple:</strong></p>

                    <p>&nbsp;To study the variation of thermo-emf with the junction of thermocouple, let us take Fe-Cu
                        thermocouple as
                        shown in fig. one junction of thermocouple is immersed into melting ice fixed at0℃ 𝑎𝑛𝑑
                        another junction is
                        immersed into heating oil . Initially, if both junction have same temperature, then there is no
                        deflection in
                        the galvanometer ie no emf induced. If the temperature of hot junction increases the deflection
                        in the
                        galvanometer ie emf induced. And emf becomes maximum for particular value of temperature of hot
                        junction. The
                        temperature of hot junction at which the thermo-emf maximum is called neutral temperature 𝜃𝑛
                        if we further
                        increase the temperature of hot junction the thermo-emf decreases and becomes zero. The
                        temperature of hot
                        junction at which thermo[1]emf becomes zero is called inversion temperature 𝜃𝑖 . If 𝜃𝑐 is
                        the temperature of
                        cold junction then</p>

                    <p>𝜃𝑛 = (𝜃𝑐+𝜃𝑖)/ 2</p>

                    <p>The variation of thermo-emf ( 𝜀 ) with temperature 𝜃 of hot junction is given by</p>

                    <p>𝜀 = 𝛼𝜃 + 𝛽 (𝜃<sup>2</sup>/2) Where 𝛼 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛽 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑠.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Thermo-electric power:</strong></p>

                    <p>It is defined as the rate of change of thermo-emf with temperature. ie, 𝑃 = 𝑑𝜀 /𝑑𝑇</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Peltier effect:</strong> The phenomenon of evolution or absorption heat across the
                        junction of
                        thermocouple when electric current passes through it is called Peltier effect. It is inverse
                        process of seebeck
                        effect.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Peltier coefficient</strong>: It is defined as the product of thermo-electric power and
                        absolute
                        temperature. It is denoted by 𝜋. 𝜋 = 𝑇 (𝑑𝜀 /dT)</p>

                    <p><strong>Thomson effect:</strong> The phenomenon of evolution or absorption of heat when electric
                        current passes
                        through unequally heated conductor is called Thomson effect.</p>

                    <p><strong>Positive Thomson effect:</strong> If heat is evolved across the junction when electric
                        current passes
                        through hotter side to colder side of a conductor then this type of effect is called positive
                        Thomson effect.
                        For example copper, silver, zinc, antimony, cadmium etc.</p>

                    <p><strong>Negative Thomson effect :</strong> If heat is absorbed across the junction when electric
                        current passes
                        through hotter side to colder side of a conductor then this type of effect is called negative
                        Thomson effect.
                        For example iron, bismuth, platinum, cobalt etc.</p>

                    <p><strong>Neutral Thomson effect:</strong> Neither heat is evolved nor absorbed across the junction
                        when electric
                        current passes through hotter side to colder side or vice versa is called neutral Thomson
                        effect. For example
                        lead 𝑃𝑏 . So lead is used as standard metal in thermoelectricity.</p>
