                    <p>The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy in a closed system is conserved and that the
                        change in energy
                        is equal to the heat added to the system plus the work done on the system.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Thermodynamic systems</strong></p>

                    <p>A thermodynamic system is a specific region where heat, work, and mass are exchanged.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Thermodynamic processes: Adiabatic, isochoric, isothermal and isobaric</strong></p>

                    <p>Thermodynamic processes refer to changes that occur within a thermodynamic system and are
                        categorized as
                        adiabatic (no heat exchange with surroundings), isochoric (constant volume), isothermal
                        (constant temperature),
                        or isobaric (constant pressure).</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Heat capacities of an ideal gas at constant pressure and volume and relation between
                            them</strong></p>

                    <p>Heat capacities of an ideal gas refer to the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of
                        a given mass of
                        the gas by a certain amount (usually one degree). There are two types of heat capacities for an
                        ideal gas:
                        constant pressure (Cp) and constant volume (Cv).</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) is the amount of heat required to raise the
                        temperature of a given
                        mass of gas at constant pressure, while the heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) is the amount
                        of heat required
                        to raise the temperature of a given mass of gas at constant volume.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The relationship between Cp and Cv for an ideal gas is given by Cp - Cv = R, where R is the gas
                        constant. This
                        relationship arises because an ideal gas does not occupy a specific volume and the internal
                        energy of an ideal
                        gas depends only on its temperature, not its pressure or volume.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>In other words, the difference between Cp and Cv represents the change in internal energy that
                        results from a
                        change in pressure (or volume) at constant temperature.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Isothermal and Adiabatic processes for an ideal gas.</strong></p>

                    <p>An <strong>isothermal process</strong> for an ideal gas occurs at a constant temperature, T.
                        During this process,
                        heat is added to the system, which results in an increase in internal energy of the gas. The
                        amount of heat
                        added is equal to the work done by the system, according to the First Law of Thermodynamics:</p>

                    <p>Q = &Delta;U + W</p>

                    <p>Where Q is the heat added, &Delta;U is the change in internal energy, and W is the work done by
                        the system.</p>

                    <p>An adiabatic process for an ideal gas occurs without heat exchange with the surroundings. In this
                        process, the
                        temperature of the gas changes due to work done on or by the system. The change in internal
                        energy of the gas
                        can be calculated using the First Law of Thermodynamics:</p>

                    <p>&Delta;U = Q - W</p>

                    <p>However, since there is no heat exchange with the surroundings, Q = 0, and therefore:</p>

                    <p>&Delta;U = -W</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>In an <strong>adiabatic</strong> <strong>process</strong>, the change in internal energy of an
                        ideal gas is equal
                        to the work done by the system. The internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its
                        temperature and can be
                        calculated using the ideal gas law:</p>

                    <p>U = nCvT</p>

                    <p>Where n is the number of moles of gas and Cv is the heat capacity at constant volume. By
                        differentiating this
                        equation with respect to T, we can find the change in internal energy:</p>

                    <p>dU = nCv dT</p>

                    <p>This equation can be combined with the equation for &Delta;U in an adiabatic process to find the
                        relationship
                        between the change in temperature and the work done by the system:</p>

                    <p>nCv dT = -dW</p>

                    <p>This equation can be integrated to find the change in temperature of an ideal gas in an adiabatic
                        process. The
                        result depends on the initial and final temperatures, the heat capacity at constant volume, and
                        the work done by
                        the system.</p>
