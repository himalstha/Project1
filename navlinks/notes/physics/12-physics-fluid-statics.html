                    <p><strong>Fluid Statics:</strong><br />
                        Fluid statics is the study of fluids at rest, and it deals with the pressure and forces in a
                        fluid.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pressure in a fluid:</strong><br />
                        Pressure in a fluid is the force per unit area exerted on a surface by the fluid. The pressure
                        in a fluid
                        decreases with increasing depth due to the weight of the fluid above it.</p>

                    <p><strong>Buoyancy:</strong><br />
                        Buoyancy is the upward force exerted on an object immersed in a fluid, due to the difference in
                        pressure between
                        the top and bottom of the object. Archimedes&#39; principle states that the buoyant force is
                        equal to the weight
                        of the fluid displaced by the object.</p>

                    <p><strong>Surface Tension:</strong><br />
                        Surface tension is the property of a liquid that causes its surface to be slightly contracted
                        and behave as
                        though it were a thin sheet. The theory of surface tension states that the molecules at the
                        surface of a liquid
                        are attracted to each other more strongly than they are to the molecules in the air.</p>

                    <p><strong>Surface Energy:</strong><br />
                        Surface energy is the energy associated with the formation of new surfaces in a material. It is
                        a measure of the
                        energy required to create a new surface and is proportional to the surface area.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Angle of Contact:</strong><br />
                        The angle of contact is the angle between a liquid surface and a solid surface in contact with
                        it. It is used to
                        determine the shape of a liquid in a container, as well as its height and volume.</p>

                    <p><strong>Capillarity:</strong><br />
                        Capillarity is the ability of a liquid to rise or fall in a narrow tube due to the
                        intermolecular forces between
                        the liquid and the solid surface of the tube. This phenomenon is used in many applications,
                        including ink pens
                        and blood pressure monitoring.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Fluid Dynamics:</strong><br />
                        Fluid dynamics is the study of fluids in motion, and it deals with the velocity and pressure of
                        fluids.</p>

                    <p><strong>Newton&#39;s Formula for Viscosity in a Liquid:</strong></p>

                    <p>Newton&#39;s formula for viscosity in a liquid states that the shear stress in a fluid is
                        proportional to the
                        velocity gradient in the fluid. It is expressed as:</p>

                    <p><strong>&tau; = &eta; * dv/dy</strong></p>

                    <p>where <strong>&tau;</strong> is the shear stress, <strong>&eta;</strong> is the viscosity, and
                        <strong>dv/dy</strong> is the velocity gradient.
                    </p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Coefficient of Viscosity:</strong></p>

                    <p>The coefficient of viscosity is a measure of a fluid&#39;s resistance to flow. It is defined as
                        the ratio of
                        shear stress to the velocity gradient in the fluid.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Poiseuille&#39;s Formula: </strong></p>

                    <p>Poiseuille&#39;s formula is used to calculate the pressure drop in a fluid flowing through a pipe
                        or a vessel. It
                        is expressed as:</p>

                    <p><strong>&Delta;P = (8 * &eta; * L * Q) / (&pi; * r^4)</strong></p>

                    <p>where <strong>&Delta;P</strong> is the pressure drop, <strong>&eta;</strong> is the viscosity,
                        <strong>L</strong>
                        is the length of the pipe, <strong>Q</strong> is the flow rate, and <strong>r</strong> is the
                        radius of the
                        pipe.
                    </p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Stokes Law:</strong></p>

                    <p>Stokes law is used to calculate the force required to move a small spherical object through a
                        fluid. It is
                        expressed as:</p>

                    <p><strong>F = 6 * &pi; * &eta; * r * v</strong></p>

                    <p>&nbsp;where F is the force, &eta; is the viscosity, r is the radius of the sphere, and v is the
                        velocity of the
                        sphere.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Equation of Continuity:</strong></p>

                    <p>The equation of continuity states that the rate of flow of a fluid through a pipe or channel must
                        remain
                        constant. It is expressed as:</p>

                    <p><strong>A1 * v1 = A2 * v2</strong></p>

                    <p>where A1 and A2 are the cross-sectional areas of the pipe or channel, and v1 and v2 are the
                        velocities of the
                        fluid at the two points.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Bernoulli&#39;s Equation: </strong></p>

                    <p>Bernoulli&#39;s equation is used to describe the relationship between pressure and velocity in a
                        fluid. It states
                        that the total energy of a fluid, including pressure and velocity energy, remains constant along
                        a streamline.
                        It is expressed as:</p>

                    <p><strong>P + 1/2 * &rho; * v^2 + &rho; * g * h = constant</strong></p>

                    <p>where P is the pressure, &rho; is the density of the fluid, v is the velocity of the fluid, g is
                        the acceleration
                        due to gravity, and h is the height of the fluid.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Bernoulli&#39;s equation is widely used in many applications, such as fluid flow in
                            pipes, fluid flow in
                            open channels, fluid flow in venturis, fluid flow in orifices, fluid flow in nozzle and many
                            more. It helps
                            in understanding the pressure distribution in a fluid and how it affects the flow of the
                            fluid.</strong></p>
