                    <p><strong>Electromagnetic Induction</strong></p>

                    <p>Electromagnetic or magnetic induction is defined as the production of an electromotive force
                        across
                        an electrical
                        conductor in a changing magnetic field.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Magnetic flux </strong><strong>𝜙 :</strong></p>

                    <p>&nbsp;The magnetic flux through any surface placed in a magnetic field is defined as the total
                        number
                        of magnetic
                        lines of force crossing this surface normally.</p>

                    <p>Suppose a magnetic field 𝐵 makes an angle 𝜃 with the normal drawn to surface area A, then the
                        magnetic flux linked
                        with this area is</p>

                    <p>𝜙&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙
                        𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝐵
                        &times; 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎</p>

                    <p>= 𝐵 cos 𝜃 &times; 𝐴</p>

                    <p>= 𝐵𝐴 cos 𝜃</p>

                    <p>= 𝐵 ∙ 𝐴</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Here the direction of vector 𝐴 Ԧ is the direction of the outward drawn normal to the surface.
                        Hence,
                        magnetic flux
                        is the dot product of two vectors B and A. So it is a scalar quantity.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Special cases:</strong></p>

                    <p>&nbsp;When 𝜃 = 0&deg; ie, the normal to the surface area is parallel to magnetic field
                        then<br />
                        &nbsp;𝜙 = 𝐵𝐴 cos 0&deg; = 𝐵𝐴 𝑚𝑎x𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒</p>

                    <p>When 𝜃 = 90&deg; ie, the normal to the surface area is perpendicular to magnetic field then 𝜙 =
                        𝐵𝐴 cos 90&deg; =
                        0 𝑚𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒</p>

                    <p><strong>Dimension formula for magnetic flux: </strong></p>

                    <p>Now we have,</p>

                    <p>𝜙 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 𝐵𝐴</p>

                    <p>= A *𝐹/ (𝑞𝑣 sin 𝜃 )𝐴</p>

                    <p style="margin-left:.5in;">= ([𝑀𝐿𝑇 <sup>&minus;2</sup>]/[ 𝐴𝑇][ 𝐿𝑇<sup>&minus;1</sup>])
                        𝐿<sup>
                            2</sup></p>

                    <p style="margin-left:.5in;">= [𝑀𝐿 <sup>2</sup>𝑇 <sup>&minus;2</sup>𝐴 &minus;<sup>1</sup> ]</p>

                    <p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Units of magnetic flux: </strong></p>

                    <p>SI unit, since 𝜙 = 𝐵𝐴 = 1 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑙𝑎 &times; 1𝑚2 = 1𝑇𝑚2 = 1 𝑤𝑒𝑏𝑒𝑟</p>

                    <p>Hence, one weber is the flux produced when a uniform magnetic field of one tesla acts normally
                        over
                        an area of 1𝑚2 .
                    </p>

                    <p>In CGS system, unit of magnetic flux is Maxwell</p>

                    <p>1𝑀𝑎𝑥𝑤𝑒𝑙𝑙 = 10&minus;8𝑊𝑒𝑏𝑒𝑟</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Faraday&rsquo;s law of electromagnetic induction</strong></p>

                    <p>&nbsp;It states that</p>

                    <p><strong>First law:</strong> Whenever the magnetic flux linked with a closed circuit changes, an
                        emf
                        (and hence a
                        current) is induced in it which lasts only so long as the change in flux is taking place. This
                        phenomenon is known
                        as electromagnetic induction.</p>

                    <p><strong>Second law:</strong> The induced emf is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux
                        linked
                        with the closed
                        circuit.</p>

                    <p>𝑖𝑒, 𝜀 = &minus; 𝑑𝜙 /𝑑𝑡</p>

                    <p>Where &ndash; 𝑣𝑒 sign shows that the direction of induced current opposes the cause which
                        produces
                        it, 𝑖𝑒, it
                        opposes the change in magnetic flux.</p>

                    <p>If the coil contains N number of turns then</p>

                    <p>𝜀 = &minus;𝑁 𝑑𝜙/𝑑𝑡</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Lenz&rsquo;s law</strong></p>

                    <p>It states that &lsquo; the direction of induced current in a circuit is such that it opposes the
                        cause or the change
                        which produces it.</p>

                    <p>Suppose a closed coil placed near a bar magnet south pole pointing towards it. As the magnet is
                        moved
                        towards the
                        coil, flux linked with the coil change, so that emf is induced and an induced current flows in
                        the
                        coil. This
                        current produced in the coil opposes the moving magnet.</p>

                    <p>But as the magnet is moved away from the coil, the induced emf again produces current but in
                        opposite
                        direction as
                        before. So the magnet will be attracted by the magnetic field due to induced current.</p>

                    <p>Hence, this shows that current due to induced emf produces magnetic field such that it opposes
                        the
                        motion of the
                        magnet which is the cause producing the current.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Lenz law is in accordance with the conservation of energy:</strong></p>

                    <p>Suppose a closed coil placed near a bar magnet with the south pole pointing towards the coil.
                        When
                        the magnet is
                        moved towards the coil, the flux linked with the coil changes so that an emf is induced in it
                        and a
                        current flows in
                        the coil. Due to this current, a magnetic field is produced in the coil which opposes the
                        approaching magnet. We
                        have to do work to move magnet toward the coil and therefore, mechanical energy is applied to
                        move
                        the magnet. That
                        is mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy in the coil.</p>

                    <p>Similarly, if the magnet is moved away from the coil, the induced current in the coil produces a
                        magnetic field which
                        attracts the bar magnet moving away from the coil. In this way energy changes from one form to
                        another form in Lenz
                        law and similar condition can be obtained while moving the magnet away from the coil. Hence,
                        Lenz
                        law is in
                        accordance with the law of conservation of energy.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Fleming&rsquo;s Right Hand Rule </strong></p>

                    <p>It states that &lsquo; if the forefinger, middle finger and thumb of right hand are stretched
                        such
                        that the thumb
                        shows the direction of motion of conductor and fore finger shows the direction of magnetic field
                        then the middle
                        finger shows the direction of induced current&rsquo;.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>&nbsp;Induced emf in a straight conductor moving in a uniform magnetic field: </strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>Suppose a straight conductor PQ having length 𝑙 moving at right angle to a uniform vertical
                        magnetic
                        B with a
                        velocity 𝑣. Let the conductor moves through a small distance 𝑥 in time t, then the area swept
                        out
                        by the conductor
                        is</p>

                    <p>𝐴𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑝𝑡 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝐴 &nbsp;= 𝑙 &times; 𝑥</p>

                    <p>Magnetic flux linked with the area A is</p>

                    <p>𝜙 = 𝐵 &times; 𝐴 = 𝐵𝑙𝑥</p>

                    <p>Now, from Faraday&rsquo;s law, the magnitude of induced emf in a conductor is</p>

                    <p>|𝜀 |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 𝑑𝜙/𝑑𝑡</p>

                    <p>= 𝐵𝑙𝑣</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>If the speed of conductor makes an angle 𝜃 with magnetic field then</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;𝜀 = 𝐵𝑙𝑣 sin 𝜃</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Induced emf in a coil rotating in a magnetic field</strong>:</p>

                    <p>Suppose a rectangular coil of N number of turns, each coil having area A. let the coil be rotated
                        in

                        the
                        field. 𝜃 is the
                        angle made by normal to the coil with magnetic field. The magnetic flux linked with each turn of
                        the
                        coil is</p>

                    <p>𝜙&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 𝐵𝐴 cos 𝜃</p>

                    <p>= 𝐴𝐵 cos 𝜔𝑡</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Now, from Faraday&rsquo;s law of electromagnetic induction,</p>

                    <p>𝜀 =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &minus;𝑁 𝑑𝜙/𝑑𝑡</p>

                    <p>= &minus;𝑁 𝑑 (𝐴𝐵 cos 𝜔𝑡)/𝑑𝑡</p>

                    <p>= &minus;𝑁𝐴𝐵 (𝑑 cos 𝜔𝑡)/𝑑𝑡</p>

                    <p>If the resistance of the coil is R then the current flowing through the coil is</p>

                    <p><strong>Self inductance </strong></p>

                    <p>It is the property of coil by virtue of which it opposes the growth or decay of current flowing
                        through it.</p>

                    <p>If I is the current flowing through a coil then experimentally it is found that the magnetic flux
                        𝜙
                        linked with the
                        coil is proportional to the current flowing</p>

                    <p>𝑜𝑟,𝜙 = 𝐿𝐼;</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;where L is proportionality constant known as coefficient of self induction or self
                        inductance.
                    </p>

                    <p>Now from Faraday&rsquo;s law of electromagnetic induction,</p>

                    <p>𝜀 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = &minus; 𝑑𝜙/𝑑𝑡</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;= &minus; 𝑑 (𝐿𝐼)/𝑑𝑡</p>

                    <p>= &minus;𝐿 (𝑑𝐼/𝑑𝑡 )</p>

                    <p>𝑜𝑟, 𝐿 = 𝜀 (&minus; 𝑑𝐼 / 𝑑𝑡 )</p>

                    <p>If &ndash; 𝑑𝐼/𝑑𝑡 = 1 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝐿 = 𝜀</p>

                    <p>Hence, coefficient of self induction is defined as the induced emf in the coil if rate of
                        decrease in
                        current in the
                        coil is unity. Its unit is henry H in SI units.</p>

                    <p><strong>Dimension formula of L: </strong></p>

                    <p>Now we have,</p>

                    <p>suppose a solenoid a long solenoid of length 𝑙, cross sectional area A and number of turns per
                        unit
                        length n. If I
                        is the current flowing through solenoid then magnetic field produced inside the coil is</p>

                    <p>𝐵 = 𝜇0𝑛𝐼</p>

                    <p>The total number of turns in a solenoid is 𝑁 = 𝑛𝑙. So, the total magnetic flux linked with the

                    <p>Also, the magnetic flux linked with the coil is 𝜙 = 𝐿𝐼</p>

                    <p>Now we have,</p>

                    <p>Transformer It is an electric device used to convert low alternating voltage at high current into
                        high alternating
                        voltage at low current and vice versa. It works on the principle of mutual induction.</p>

                    <p>When an a.c. source is connected to the primary coil, an alternating current flows through it.
                        The
                        current produced a
                        magnetic field, so the magnetic flux linked with the coil is changed. The changing magnetic flux
                        induces an
                        alternating emf in the secondary coil. The iron core is capable of coupling the whole magnetic
                        flux
                        produced by
                        primary coil with the secondary coils.𝑁𝑝 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑁𝑠 are the number of turns in primary and
                        secondary coils
                        respectively.</p>
