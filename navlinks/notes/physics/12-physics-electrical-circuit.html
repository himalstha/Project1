                <h3 id="kichhoffs-law">Kichhoff&#39;s law :</h3>

                <p>To solve the complex electric circuit,&nbsp;kichhoff generate kichhoffs law.</p>

                <p>There are two laws of kichhoff:&nbsp;</p>

                <p>1. Kichhoff&#39;s 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;law : Kichhoff&#39;ss first law is also know as junction law.
                    One or more than one electric conductor join or connected then the incomming current is equal to the
                    outgoing current or the algebraic sum of a current at a point of junction is Zero.</p>

                <p>2. Kichhoff&#39;s 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;law: Kichhof&#39;s second law is also known as the loop law.
                    Kichhoff&#39;s second law state that &quot;The algebraic sum of emf of cell and the potential drop
                    is equal to zero&quot;. i.e Total&nbsp;emf + total IR = 0</p>
                <h3 id="wheatstone-bridge"><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">Wheatstone Bridge Principle</span></h3>

                <p>Wheatstone Bridge is an electric circuit that consist of four resistor in four
                    arms three are known
                    resistor and one is unknown. Wheat stone bridge principle is used to know the value of unknown
                    resistor with the help of known resistors.</p>

                <p>Wheatstone Bridge principle state that &quot;At the balance condition the product of resistors of
                    opposite arms of&nbsp;the circut is equal&quot;.</p>

                <h3><span style="color: rgb(47, 79, 79);">Meter Bridge Principle</span></h3>

                <p>Meter bridge is also an electric circuit that works on the principle of wheatstone bridge principle.
                </p>

                <p>Meter bridge is made up of wooden that consist of who resistor one is known and one is unknown. And
                    connect with the one meter long electric conductor wire. By the help of the known resistor and the
                    one meter long wire we can find the value of unknown resistor.</p>

                <h3 id="potentiometer"><span style="color:#2F4F4F;">Potentiometer</span></h3>

                <p>Potentiometer consist of 10 meter long wire and two cell with potentiometer circuit. Two cells are
                    connect with key to open and close the key while comparing.</p>

                <p>Potentiometer is also a electric circut. It is used for:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>1. Comparing the emf of cell</li>
                    <li>2. Calculating emf of two cells.</li>
                    <li>3. Finding&nbsp;the internal resistane of cells</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>To compare and calculate emf of cells:</h4>

                <p>When first key is closed and second key is open and jockey slide from initial point to another point
                    where galvanometer doesn&#39;t shows any deflection. At that point the potential difference of the
                    wire from initial point to final point will be equal to the emf of the first cell. And from the
                    principle of potentiometer length of wire is directly proportional to the potential difference of
                    wire so emf of 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;cell will be directly proportional to l<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;length
                    of wire.</p>

                <p>Similarly, when first key is open and second key is closed and jockey slide form initial point to
                    another point where galvanometer don&#39;t show any deflection. At that point the potential
                    difference of the wire will be equal to the emf of 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;cell and the length obtained
                    be l<sub>2</sub>. But according to the potentiometer principle length of wire is directly
                    proportional to the potential difference then we can say that emf of 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;cell is
                    directly proportional to the l<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;length of wire.</p>

                <p>Like this we can compare the emf of cells.</p>

                <p>And from that comparing and generating equation and measuring the length of wire we can obtained the
                    value of emf of two cells.</p>

                <h3>To find the internal resistance of wire:</h3>

                <p>In potentometer one cell is connect and one resistance box is conneted to the key.</p>

                <p>Wen key is open then jockey slide from one point to another point then the&nbsp; emf of cell will be
                    equal to the pd of wide across initial point to another point. From principle of potentiometer
                    length of wire is directly proportional to the the podential difference so length of wire is
                    directly proportional to emf of cell. After key is closed then the length gets changed and will be
                    directly proportional to the potential difference of that length wire. By equating the equation we
                    can find the internal resistane of cell.</p>

                <p><strong>What is Galvanometer?</strong></p>

                <p>Galvanometer is a very low resistance&nbsp;device connect in series, that just show the current is
                    flowing or not in a conductor.</p>

                <p><strong>What is ammeter?</strong></p>

                <p>Ammeter is also a velry low resistance electric device that is conneted in series to find the value
                    of current flowing in circuit.</p>

                <p><strong>What is Voltmeter?</strong></p>

                <p>Vlometer is a high resistance electric device that is connected parallel to the circuit to find the
                    potential difference in a wire.</p>

                <p><strong>What is ohm-meter?</strong></p>

                <p>Ohm-meter is a electric device that used to measure the resistance of resistor.</p>

                <h3 id="gtova">Convert Galvanometer into Ammeter:</h3>

                <p>Conversion of galvanometer to the ammeter can simply done by connecting shunt parrell to the
                    galvanometer.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Shunt: Shut is a resistor that carry very less resistance value.</p>

                <p>When shunt is added parrel to the galvanometer and supply current I, the potential difference across
                    shunt will be equal to the potential difference across galvanometer and equating we can know the
                    value of shunt. By this method we can convert galvanometer into ammeter.</p>

                <h3>Convert Galvanometer into Voltmeter:</h3>

                <p>To convert galvanometer into volt meter we need to connect a large resistance resistor to the
                    galvanometer in series. So the total resistance will be sum of resistance of galvanometer and
                    resistance of large resistance resistor.</p>

                <h3 id="jouleslaw">Joule&#39;s law of Heating:</h3>

                <p>When charge q is flowing in a wire in time t. I = q/t.&nbsp; &nbsp;or, q=I.t</p>

                <p>According to ohm&#39;s law: V = IR</p>

                <p>But, the electric potential is the work done per unit charge.</p>

                <p>q: V = w/q&nbsp;</p>

                <p>or, w = V.q = I.R.I.t = I<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;R t&nbsp;</p>

                <p>This amount of work is stored in the wire in the form of heat energy so w=h.</p>

                <p>Hence,&nbsp;H =&nbsp;I<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;R t&nbsp;</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
